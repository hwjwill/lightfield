# Lightfield Camera

As [this paper](http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/lfcamera/lfcamera-150dpi.pdf) by Ng et al. demonstrated, capturing multiple images over a plane orthogonal to the optical axis enables achieving complex effects using very simple operations like shifting and averaging. The goal of this project is to reproduce some of these effects using real lightfield data. Fore more results: http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs194-26/fa16/upload/files/proj6/cs194-26-acm/
